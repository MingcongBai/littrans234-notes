==================================

Movie: "The Russian Revolution" (2017).

- Assassination of Tsar Alexandre II, by "People's Will" - in a bomb attack.
- Alexandre III succeeded Alexandre II as Tsar.
- Industrialisation as a response to the defeat in the Crimea War in the 1850s.
    - Political system remained autocratic, unlike other aspects with great
      dynamics in the latter half of the 19th century.
    - Oppositions were ruthlessly suppressed.
- Lenin's older cousin, intelligent like Lenin himself, plotted to assassinate
  Tsar Alexandre III with a bomb (Aleksandr Ulianov, Lenin is a pseudo name of
  Vladimir Ulianov).
    - Hung, as their motives were discovered by imperial police.
    - Inspired Lenin. While his attempt to help her mother to the city where
      Aleksandr was to be hung (and all burgeois he could ask refused), changed
      his perspective of the burgeois.
- Lenin was able to evade authorities, while inspired himself with the novel
  "What is to be Done", claiming that it influenced himself more than anything
  from Marx.
- Nicholas succeded Tsar Alexandre III. Nicholas was attacked earlier in Japan,
  by a policeman.
    - Terrified to take on responsibility, following the sudden death of
      Alexandre III.
    - Married a German queen, proven to be a difficult aspect for the family
      during the World War I.
    - Highly reliant on his advisors, and for his weak and indecisive character,
      was controlled by his own wife.
- Lenin captured and exiled to Siberia for three years, though living condition
  was quite comfortable - even hired (with incredibly low pay) a 12-year-old
  maid.
    - Returned in 1900, and moved around Europe to meet Marxists and dissidents.
- 1904, Russo-Japanese War, humiliating defeat against Japan.
- 1905 Revolution, following the defeat - as fleets destroyed, and morale
  buried in ground. Upon the soldiers' return to factories and cities, they
  were faced with brutal living and working prospects. Revolution
  was brutally crushed.
    - Nicholas did not directly command the suppression, however, did not
      respond for fear of an assassination.
- Lenin caught off guard by the Revolution of 1905 - of the
  earlier-than-expected Revolution. In fact, even in 1917, Lenin did not expect
  a revolution during his lifetime.
- The Duma - controlled and disrespected by the court.
- Lenin's patronising view of non-Russians? The "handy Georgian", Stalin.
- Stalin appeared far less knowledgable than he really was, and highly
  manipulative.
- Rasputin. Nicholas II's son Alexei was diagnosed with Hemophilia, and it was
  called upon by the court to help when Alexei fell and bleed.
    - Caused scandals in the Russian society.
- 1912, press censorship abolished (to a limited extent, though uncontrollable).
- 1914, assassination of Archduke Ferdinand.
- A "perculiar" army of the Russians - enthusiastic officers, and suffering
  soldiers. Desertions and murders of officers.
    - Fading hope for Russian victory in the World War I.
- Growing resentments in the Romanov Family regarding Rasputin and the apparent
  connected queen.
    - Rasputin and queen (Tsarina) were suspected to had been connected
      with Germany.
    - Rasputin was killed, though inefficiently. Killer regarded as national
      hero.
- Februrary Revolution of 1917, Tsar abdicated. Power vaccuum, and two factions
  struggling for power: The Soviet of Workers and Soldiers (The Petrograd
  Soviet), and the Provisional Government. Tsar family transported to "safety"
  in Siberia.
    - Provisional Government decided to carry on the war effort.
    - Lenin was against the war. "Better that the kaiserism wins, than another
      day for the Tsar".
- Lenin returned in Russia at the Finland Station of Petrograd. Gave a speech
  at his armoured car, "all powers to the Soviet!".
- Lenin charged of treason in July - for money received from Germany, and
  he retreated to Finland.
- October 31st, and the October Revolution - a coup d'etat.
- The October Revolution should be considered a stage in a contiguous warfare.
  Revolution originated in Petrograd, Moscow, then violent murderous moving
  across townships and rural areas.
    - Violent repression became the dominant methodology of Soviet revolutions.
    - Tsar family murdered in 1918, July 17th in Yekaterinburg.
